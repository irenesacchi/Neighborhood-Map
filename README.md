# ==Münster Playground Map==

This is a web-app created for displaying playgrounds in the center of Münster.

The infowindow of the several playgrounds come with the name and the picture of the place.

The search input placeholder help looping and filtering through the list of places displayed. You can choose the open the infowindow through the marker or the element on the list.

The app is build with javascrpit and knockout and it is scalable with lots of entries :) Locations and styles of the map are saved in differents js. This can help the easy stiling and the introduction of new entries in the list.

And it is of course responsive ;-)
